# Snake Game

A classic Snake game implemented in Java with Swing.

## Introduction

This project is a simple yet entertaining implementation of the classic Snake game. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating apples to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the screen borders.

## Features

### Regular Apples

Regular apples appear at random locations on the screen. When the snake eats a regular apple, it grows longer, and the player earns points. The goal is to eat as many regular apples as possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the screen borders.

### Large Apples (Work-in-Progress)

One of the additional features attempted is the introduction of large apples. After the player successfully consumes a certain number of regular apples (every 10 apples), a large apple should appear. The player then has a limited time (5 seconds) to eat as many large apples as possible, with each large apple being worth more points (3 points).

### Game Over

The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the screen borders. The final score is displayed, and the player has the option to try again or quit the game.

## Issues

Despite efforts to implement the large apple feature, there are challenges, and the intended functionality may not work as expected. The large apples might not appear correctly, and the issue persists.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iammichaelbryan/Snake-Game
